An alexa skill game involving quiz, lists and maths...could anything be better?

So because the Amazon docs and samples are all a bit...old skool...and aren't aimed at a fully working skill implementation, this is my offering - let me know what you think in the Issues/PR section(s).

Features:

* ES2015 (node 4.3.2 compatible ðŸ™„)
* Airbnb eslint config
* Modular
* TDD with tests taking form of; describe:user intent, it:response and actions
* Gulp pipeline for easy deployment to AWS Lambda
* Functional Programming style (where possible due to OO and use of `this` in SDK)

Todo:

* Add end game
* Add multiplayer bits
* Add advanced difficulty bits
* Add non-golden path scenarios
* Get the thing published
* Write tutorial
