An alexa skill game involving quiz, lists and maths...could anything be better?

So because the Amazon docs and samples are all a bit...old skool...and aren't aimed at a fully working skill implementation, this is my offering - let me know what you think in the Issues/PR section(s).

## Features:

* ES2015 (node 4.3.2 compatible ðŸ™„)
* Airbnb eslint config
* Modular
* TDD with tests taking form of; describe:user intent, it:response and actions
* Gulp pipeline for easy deployment to AWS Lambda (borrowed heavily from [ThoughtWorks](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksStudios/node-aws-lambda))
* Functional Programming style (where possible due to OO and use of `this` in SDK)

## Todo:

* Add advanced difficulty bits
* Get the thing published
* Write tutorial
* Join up the utterances a bit better as they're sort of in three places, possibly using [alexa-utterances](https://github.com/mreinstein/alexa-utterances)

## Lessons learned so far...

* Alexa very rarely understands what I'm saying, two and four appear to be particularly tricky for her
* Can't find any docs on `emitWithState` but what it actually means is, "call an internal intent"
* Keep the handlers granular to make the failure intents much easier to capture and manage, and especially with more ambiguous intents such as "yes" and "no"

## Tips:

Use this in the [Alexa dev console](https://developer.amazon.com) so you can nicely scroll into view and see the JSON.
I found this a much easier way to test (after the TDD tests *ahem* #obvs) because Alexa can never understand what I'm saying

```javascript
document.head.getElementsByTagName('style')[0].sheet.insertRule('.AppManagementViewContainer { overflow: visible !important; }', 0);
document.head.getElementsByTagName('style')[0].sheet.insertRule('.Simulator-tab { display: flex; flex-flow: column; }', 1);
document.head.getElementsByTagName('style')[0].sheet.insertRule('.CodeMirror { width: 1500px !important; }', 2);
```

After making sure it's all working "for real" then give it a spin on [Echoism](https://echosim.io/)
